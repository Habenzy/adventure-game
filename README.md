## Why Hello there! You've found my little text adventure game!

It's a pretty simple setup, just something to play around with really. The game logic runs on an express.js server with a React frontend. Currently you can:
- Name yourself
- Unlock, and move between "rooms"
- Examine "rooms"
- Examine, pick up, and use various items
- Die

### Install Instructions

- Clone down this repository
- `cd` into the directory
- `npm install`
- `cd client`
- `npm install`
- `cd ..` (you should be back at the root directory at this point)
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`
- Pop your browser open and visit https://localhost:5500 to play the game
